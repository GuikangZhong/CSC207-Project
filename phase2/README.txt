 Welcome to use the hiring system!

  Getting started.

​	When you run the program for the first time, the program initially contains no information. To get started you need to signed up as applicant, HR manager, or interviewer. Before you sign up as a HR manager or an interviewer, make sure that you have selected a corresponding company, or create a new one and select it if you want(For HR managers, you can join multiple companies, but if you do you need to choose a company you want to sign in as whenever you log in, and interviewer should join one and only one company); besides creating a brand-new company, you can also create a new company that is a subsidiary of a company that has already in your system. Without choosing a company, you will not be able to successfully sign up. After you enter a username ,real name and password, click `sign up` button. If clicking the button does not work, then it may mean that the username has already been taken. You can sign up without any password if you want, but you have to enter a username.

The system state information will be stored in the file named **auto.ser**, and there will be a file **log.txt** to record the important event that took place in the system.

NOTE: On the teaching lab machine, when you run the program at the first place, there may be some display issue. Just adjust the size of the window or click outside the GUI window to fix the problem.

 Special Cases about hiring

​	Interviewers will determine which applicants will be forwarded to the next round of the interviews for a certain job posting. After the end of each round of interview, if the number of applicants getting forwarded becomes less than or equal to the number of applicants needed, the applicants remaining will automatically be hired and the job posting will be listed as FILLED. But there are some special possible cases in the hiring cycle.
The possible special cases are:

1. After a certain round of interview, the number of applicants being forwarded is less than the number needed; in this case, the job posting will be automatically listed as UNFILLED. 
2. During the process of the interview, someone withdrew the application, resulting in the number of applicants in the current applicant pool the same as the number of candidates needed for the JobPosting. In this case, the persons remaining will be automatically hired, and the job posting will be listed as ,FILLED the current round of interview will terminate, and it becomes impossible for the remaining applicants to withdraw the application from this job posting.
3. The maximum of rounds of interviews has reached and there is still multiple applicants getting forwarded, resulting in a `Final Candidates` list that can be seen by the corresponding HR; after that, some applicants withdrew the application, resulting in the number of applicants in the Final Candidates list the same as the number of candidates needed. In this case, the remaining applicant will be automatically hired and the job posting is listed as `FILLED`, but the HR can still see the Final Candidates list with applicants in it; however, it is not possible to select the applicant and click `Hire` since the applicant has already been hired.  When you sign in as HR and find this happen, just leave it as it is, and the applicants in the list are exactly the ones that are hired. Furthermore, it will become impossible for the remaining applicant to withdraw the application.
4. The number of applicants applying for the JobPosting is exactly the same as the number needed. In this case, the applicants will not be automatically hired. The HR manager creating the job posting will still need to match the applicants with interviewers, and if the interviewers forward all the applicant to the next round, the applicants will get hired and the job posting will be listed as FILLED; otherwise, the job posting will be listed as UNFILLED, and the applicants getting forwarded(if any) will be hired.
5. The number of applicants applying for the JobPosting is . In this case, HR manager creating the job posting should still assign the applicants with interviewers for the first round of interview. After the first round, all the applicants getting forwarded by an interviewer will be hired; and the posting will be listed as UNFILLED.



 #Details for setting the system time

​	Before logging in, you can click the `Set Time` button in the login menu to set the system time. If you do not set the system time before logging in, the system time will just be the real time. If you set the time, make sure that you do not set the system time to be before the real time, and once you have set the system time, make sure that you do not set the system time back, otherwise there may be some unexpected behaviors.

And if you sign in as an applicant and then you apply for multiple job postings with different closing days, especially if you apply for a job posting with a later closing date before one with an earlier closing date, then, in order to see the functionality of showing the days since the last application closed and automatically deleting the document, please make sure you set the system time forward in a day-by-day manner. That is, if today is July 13, and you want to forward the system time from July 13 to July 20, set the system time to be July 13, July 14, July 15, ... , July 20 step by step, instead of directly setting the system time to be July 20. Otherwise you may not be able to see the correct behaviour.
